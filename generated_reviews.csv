"Fantastic spot for an even or a quiet cocktail. They were swell to host the Yelp crew with a great drink menu and super attentive staff. I'd certainly recommend anything with the purred fruit in it (apple, any of them really)!",1,Thank you for your positive feedback! We're glad you enjoyed your experience and appreciate your recommendation.
"Love, love, love the calamari. It's so good and spicy. There is an endless list of martinis and one is better than the next. There is a first and second floor, if you prefer more of a bar or lounge atmosphere. It's not a place I like for dinner, but for drinks and apps it's wonderful.",1,We're thrilled to hear you love our calamari! Thank you for your kind words about our drinks and atmosphere.
"Love this place. Stiff martinis and cocktails, cheap drinks, good service, nice atmosphere to chill in the upstairs lounge and hang up with your friends. Classy crowd and much more mature, older, and professional crowd. There aren't any of those college frat boys or belligerent drunks there, which is so great. Very nice place to wind down after a long day.",1,Thank you for your wonderful review! We're delighted you enjoyed our atmosphere and had a great time with your friends.
"It's everything a great cocktail bar should be. Great location, ambiance, cocktails and chill environment. **Disclaimer: 5 stars doesn't have to mean it's New York City good. It is a simple place and it's not flashy by any means. I'd take a girl for the beginning of a date or on the opposite end of the spectrum, talking business with colleagues.",1,Thank you for your detailed review! We're glad you find our bar meets your expectations for both casual and professional gatherings.
"I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open before all their reservations for the night started to come in. I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely loved it! The chicken had the perfect amount of spice to it which was offset with sweet with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good! The salad was even great because they used real green spring mix instead of iceberg lettuce. I also loved that they put feta cheese on top, its one of my favorite cheeses for salad topping! Service was great here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy! Love this place and can't wait for my next visit!",1,Thank you for your wonderful review! We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed the chicken jerk sandwich and our service. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!
"Olive or Twist is the historic site of my VERY FIRST MARTINI when I turned 21, many years ago. It's been a long, happy union. While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me because I love it. It's one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTENTLY good for years! The interior is warm and a little bit industrial. The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice. The drinks are great although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't forget! [well, this one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu. I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me and sarcastically said, 'Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't you.' Then, I refused to let him even try it bc it was that good. It was MINE. I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great and came out looking so pretty I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less. Whatever. She needs a martini. The service was great. Our waitress, Lauren, was really cool and very good at recommending the drinksâ€”the chipotle martini was her recommendation, I would never have ordered that on my own. We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served in a martini glass and it was really good. My favorite thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years. It's delicious. It's so good that Lauren and I actually high fived when she brought it out. (true story.) My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, it was gone within minutes so that is a good sign. I highly recommend this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date. This is one of my favorite downtown lunch spots!",1,Thank you for sharing your delightful memories with us! We're glad you enjoyed your first martini and the recommendations. We hope to serve you again soon!

"The location is in a strip mall, but this place is a diamond in the rough. The food was some of the best Italian food I have had anywhere. I live in Kansas City, which has a pretty large and longstanding Italian population. The food is as good as any of the old Italian places in KC. Everyone in my group was amazed at the quality of the food for the price. I will keep this one on my list of places to come back to when I am in AZ again.",1,We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your experience with us! Thank you for the high praise on our Italian cuisine.
